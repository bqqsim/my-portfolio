  <div class="homepagetxt">Hey there! This is the development portfolio for Baasim! You can find several things about the
    creator of this webpage
    such as a simple introduction of the Man of the Hour or maybe his accomplishments! That's all from me, have fun!</div>

<h2 id= assignhome><u>Assignments</u></h2>
<p id= assigntxt>Under "Assignments" you will find all of my work in 2020 for the course ICS3U0. I was introduced <br>
to coding in grade 11 and had almost 0 experience. The "Assignments" tab will include every assignment<br> I have
 completed, even if it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The assignments that I am more proud of <br>
or I did the best in will be at the top, while the ones that kind of didn’t meet the expectations or just weren’t the <br> 
best will be near the bottom. </p>

<h2 id= accomp><u>Accomplishments</u></h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id= acomptxt>Under "Accomplishments", you will find the many successes I've experienced throughout my life so far. <br>
Although I may be really young, I am proud of what I have accomplished so far and I am ready to carry out <br> more goals that 
I have planned for myself. I will discuss things such as volunteer hours and what I have done academically, <br> or 
when it comes to sports and other things outside of school. Maybe some things that I personally feel proud
of <br> and discuss that a little bit, but in general it will be most or all of the accomplishments I have under my belt.
