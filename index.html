<h2 id= assignhome class= heading1><u>Assignments</u></h2>
<p id= assigntxt class=text1>Under "Assignments" you will find all of my work in 2020 for the course ICS3U0. I was introduced <br>
to coding in grade 11 and had almost 0 experience. The "Assignments" tab will include every assignment<br> I have
 completed, even if it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The assignments that I am more proud of <br>
or I did the best in will be at the top, while the ones that kind of didn’t meet the expectations or just weren’t the <br> 
best will be near the bottom. </p>

<h2 id= accomp class=heading2><u>Accomplishments</u></h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id= acomptxt class=text2>Under "Accomplishments", you will find the many successes I've experienced throughout my life so far.
Although I may be really young, I am proud of what I have accomplished so far and I am ready to carry out more goals that 
I have planned for myself. I will discuss things such as volunteer hours and what I have done academically, or 
when it comes to sports and other things outside of school. Maybe some things that I personally feel proud
of and discuss that a little bit, but in general it will be most or all of the accomplishments I have under my belt.
</p>

<h2 class=heading1><u>What Lies Ahead </u></h2>
<p class=text1>What Lies Ahead will just include things I have planned for the future. Special goals, or expectations I 
  <br> have in mind for when I'm older.  Small or big, I will list each dream or goal I have with a good explanation <br>
  behind it. Also, some suggestions for what I think can make a better society for humans
  and <br>other opinions I have in mind for the future. </p>

  <h2 id=mothtxt class=heading2><u>The Man Of The Hour</u></h2>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  <p class=text2>Under the The Man Of The Hour, I will talk about myself a little more such as backgrounds and more. 
   I will discuss a little bit about my personality and I will talk about my past and what
   interests I have. I will also take some time to bring up some points about how my
   education is and where I started from. Also things like my preferences for 
   certain things and what type of person I am</p>
