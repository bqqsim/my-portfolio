<p id= sportstxt>The best thing in the world to me is sports. Any type of sport will satisfy me. Football, basketball, soccer,
    hockey, whatever you want to talk about, I will be more than happy to discuss. My favourite sport is basketball. I started
playing basketball in grade 7 and still play it to this day. It is the one sport I feel like I'm the best at
and feel more confident playing. Basketball is an accomplishment for me because I got really good at it. I used to play
with people that would be 3-4 years older than me and I would be able to keep up with them. Playing with older people
at a younger age helped me be more experience and a step ahead against the kids my age. I had dreams of playing in the NBA
but, my parents disagreed and didn't like the idea of it. I still played a litt bit on the grade 9 junior varsity team, 
and the 9-12 varsity team. Sadly, all the hard work I put into basketball went down the drain because school was a priority
and I was falling off. I ended up quitting because I needed to focus on school much more, but basketball will always have
a spot in my heart and I try to play every chance I get. </p>
