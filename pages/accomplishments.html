<h2 class= header2><u>Sports</u></h2>

<p id= sportstxt>The best thing in the world to me is sports. Any type of sport will satisfy me. Football, basketball, soccer,
    hockey, whatever you want to talk about, I will be more than happy to discuss. My favourite sport is basketball. I started
playing basketball in grade 7 and still play it to this day. It is the one sport I feel like I'm the best at
and feel more confident playing. Basketball is an accomplishment for me because I got really good at it. I used to play
with people that would be 3-4 years older than me and I would be able to keep up with them. Playing with older people
at a younger age helped me be more experience and a step ahead against the kids my age. I had dreams of playing in the NBA
but, my parents disagreed and didn't like the idea of it. I still played a litt bit on the grade 9 junior varsity team, 
and the 9-12 varsity team. Sadly, all the hard work I put into basketball went down the drain because school was a priority
and I was falling off. I ended up quitting because I needed to focus on school much more, but basketball will always have
a spot in my heart and I try to play every chance I get. </p>

<h2 class= header2><u>Academics</u></h2>

<p id= sportstxt>At school, I think I tend to be pretty average. I won't say that I'm the smartest student in every 
    class I've been in, but I do a good job in most of my courses. I enjoy business and science for the most part. I also
    like math, but that's only when I understand what I'm doing. There's something about getting things correct in math whic
    is really satisfying for me. I strive to have my marks in the high 90s but, I usually stay in the high 80s or the 
    early 90s. It's good, but I have different expectations for myself. I am a part of the IBT program in school, which is a specialist
program for kids interested in technology and the world on business. I have never earned any awards academically, but I 
have been on the honour roll for my high school every semester so far, so that's something I'm proud of so far.

<h2 class=header2><u>Outside of School</u></h2>

<img id=hoop src="../images/hoopski.jpg" align=right height=300 width=250 alt= picture-of-basketball-hoop/>
<p id= OFStxt >Outside of school, I try to be as involved in the community as possible. I have volunteered at a few places so far. 
    I have volunteered at a food bank, a mosque and a little help at an event near my area. Volunteering at the food bank
    was really nice because I met a few new people and I'm still friends with them to this day. The mosque was really
    nice as well because the group that I was working with was really productive and we got a lot of work done. Outside of school
    I love to play sports as much as I can. Most of the time, you can find me with a basketball, at my nearest court 
    putting some shots up. It's my favourite pass time, but another thing I love to do is play video games. I may not
    play a lot, but I do enjoy video games when I do play. My favourite games to play are Forza Horizon 4 and for now
    Call of Duty, Modern Warfare. I'm not the greatest at Call of Duty, but it is definitely fun to play. As for my technological
    background, I am basically brand new to this. I tried to learn Java Script over the summer of '18 and '19, but I was
    really unconsistent and would slack off a lot, so I never really learned anything. I have learned HTML and CSS so far,
    so everything this website includes, will include all the skills I have learned so far!
