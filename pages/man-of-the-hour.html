    <p id=assigntxt >Hello, my name is Baasim. My birthday is on October 17, 2004 and I am a Libra! That doesn't really matter, I was just saying
    that just in case anyone was wondering. I was born in Pakistan and I came to Canada at the age of 6 in 2011. My family
    and I spent most of our lives in Dubai, except for my youngest sister. She was 1 when we moved to Canada, so she's 
    spent most of her life here! As a child I had 0 interest in school and I just wanted to either play with toys, or 
    run around and play soccer. Soccer was the first sport I fell in love with, and as I got older I started liking basketball
    more!

    <h2 id= intereststitle> <u>Interests</u></h2>
<img id=interests src="../images/interests1.png" align=right height="250" width="250" />
    <p id=intereststxt>For my interests, I really like sports. If I were to choose either video games or playing basketball outside,
        I would definitely choose to go outside and play basketball. It is my favourite pass time. I'm not too sure why
        I've grown such a strong attachment to basketball, but it is one of the things I really enjoy doing. Another one of
        my interests is playing video games. There's just something about putting a headset on and staring at the TV
        for hours that excites me on a different level. I usually never play alone though. I have three of my best friends
        hop on with me and we play for hours. The two games I play the most are Forza and Call of Duty Warzone. Forza is really
        cool because the graphics are really nice and I like racing games sometimes. It's not something I play all the time, 
        but I play Warzone with my friends a lot. Even if we're not the best at the game, we still have a great time and there's 
        never a dull moment. I can talk for hours about my interests but lastly, I am going to talk about my interest in food.
        I think food is a really cool thing. A bunch of ingredients can make such delicious things. I don't cook, but from time
        to time, I like to throw some things together and eat something. My favourite things to eat are poutine, pizza and fried
        chicken. Not the healthiest of foods, but I enjoy eating them the most.

    <h2 class=header2> <u>Personality and Taste</u></h2>

<img id=vibe src="../images/vibe-icon.png" align=right height="300" width="300" />
    <p id=vibetxt >I think I would describe myself as a good mix of an introvert and an extrovert. When I'm around people I know, I'm
        usually a really outgoing person and I try to have a really fun, exciting vibe. If it's people I'm new to, 
        I won't say I'm really dry but I just won't talk as much. I would say I am pretty hard working as well. I like
        to get tasks done as soon as possible and I strive to be better person each day. I honestly do, but I get distracted
        pretty easily. If I find a way to get those distractions out of my way, I work really well independantly. I also
        like to try new things. It doesn't really matter what it is. Food, sports, music, even school work, I like to 
        explore and find what I like. My taste when it comes to things can be kind of confusing. For example, the music that
        I enjoy listening to is from artists like the late Pop Smoke or Lil Mosey. Basically rap music, but at the same time
        I like listening to more relaxed and RnB music such as the Minecraft sound track on Spotify, Drake, or PnB Rock 
        at times. Their music is something I enjoy listening to time to time. So you can say my taste in music is pretty
        weird but, I like what I like. I never really got into watching shows either. I don't watch Netflix or any animes
        so I can't really speak on what types of shows I like to watch. I love watching movies though. I really like Disney
        movies and animated stuff. I especially like The Lion King and the Cars movies. Shrek is also one of my all time 
        favourites as well.
