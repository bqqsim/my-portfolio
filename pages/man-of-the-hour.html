    <p id=assigntxt >Hello, my name is Baasim. My birthday is on October 17, 2004 and I am a Libra! That doesn't really <br> matter, I was
        just saying that just in case anyone was wondering. I was born in Pakistan and I came <br> to Canada at the age of 6 in 2011.
        My family and I spent most of our lives in Dubai, except for my <br> youngest sister. She was 1 when we moved to Canada
        and my younger brother was 3, so they've <br> spent most of her life here! As a child I had 0 interest in school and I just
        wanted to either play with <br> toys, or run around and play soccer. Soccer was the first sport I fell in love with, and as <br>
        I got older I started liking basketball more!

    <h2 id= intereststitle> <u>Interests</u></h2>
<img id=interests src="../images/interests1.png" align=right height="250" width="250"  alt="thinking-emoji"/>
    <p id=intereststxt>For my interests, I really like sports. If I were to choose either video games or playing basketball <br> outside,
        I would definitely choose to go outside and play basketball. I'm not too sure why
        I've <br> grown such a strong attachment to basketball, but it is one of the things I really enjoy doing. <br> Another one of
        my interests is playing video games. There's just something about putting a <br> headset on and staring at the TV
        for hours that excites me to a different level. I usually never <br> play alone though. I have three of my best friends
        hop on with me and we play for hours. <br> The two games I play the most are Forza and Call of Duty Warzone. Forza is pretty
        cool and I like <br> racing games but, It's not something I play all the time. 
        I play Warzone with my friends a lot though.<br> I can talk for hours about my interests but lastly, I am going to talk about my interest in food.
        I think <br>food is a really cool thing. A bunch of ingredients can make such delicious things. I don't cook, but <br> from time
        to time, I like to throw some things together and eat something. My favourite things to eat <br> are poutine, pizza and fried
        chicken. Not the healthiest of foods, but I enjoy eating them the most. 
    </p>

    <h2 class=header2> <u>Personality and Taste</u></h2>

<img id=vibe src="../images/vibe-icon.png" align=right height="300" width="300" alt="vibe-icon" />
    <p id=vibetxt >I think I would describe myself as a good mix of an introvert and an extrovert. When I'm around<br> people I know, I'm
        usually a really outgoing person and I try to have a really fun, exciting vibe.<br> If it's people I'm new to, 
        I won't say I'm really dry but I just won't talk as much. I would say I am<br> pretty hard working well. I like
        to get tasks done as soon as possible and I strive to be better person <br> each day. I also
        like to try new things. It doesn't really matter what it is. Food, sports, music, even <br> school work, I like to 
        explore and find what I like. My taste when it comes to things can be kind of <br> confusing. For example, the music that
        I enjoy listening to is from artists like the late Pop Smoke or <br> Lil Mosey. Basically rap music, but at the same time
        I like listening to more relaxed and RnB music <br>such as the Minecraft sound track on Spotify, Drake, or PnB Rock 
        at times. Their music is something<br> I enjoy listening to time to time. So you can say my taste in music is pretty
        weird but, I like what I like. <br>I never really got into watching shows either. I don't watch Netflix or any animes
        so I can't really <br>speak on what types of shows I like to watch. I really like Disney
        movies and animated stuff though.<br> I especially like The Lion King and the Cars movies. Shrek is also one of my all time 
        favourites as well.
