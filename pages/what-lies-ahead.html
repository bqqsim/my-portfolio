<p class=text1>For my future, I imagine myself being in the technological field. I want to study software engineering <br> as I grow older and 
   I want to build a proper career out of it. I'm not too sure what job I want to have, <br> but I do know where I'm headed. 
    I also want to be in good shape as I grow  older. I don't want to gain<br> a lot of weight, because I know the
     field that I am headed towards requires a lot of sitting, so I will make sure <br>I don't slip up and become
      chubbier than I would like myself to be. I don't really tend to "dream",  but instead<br> I make  goals, so I can
       achieve whatever I have in mind. As of now, I would like to get a high average for <br> grade 11 and stay in good
        shape. I am also interested in the business world, so I have goals to get <br> involved in that field as well. I'm not
         too sure how for now, but I will figure it out as I get older. The <br> stock market has always been something that 
         I like to keep up with so maybe trading stocks as a <br> side hustle will be in my near future.

<h2 class= header2><u>For Technology</u></h2>

<img id=graph src= "../images/rocket-going-to-the-future.jpg" align=right height= 200 width= 250 alt= "code"/>
<p class=text1>As I am growing up, technology is changing as well, at  a pretty rapid pace as well. In about 10-15 years <br>
I imagine most of Canada being very different. Even if the technology is getting much more advanced, <br> our time on this Earth
is getting shorter. There is too much pollution and it is causing our Earth much <br> harm. I'm not sure how we will recover
from what we have done to Earth, but I really hope we figure out <br> something. In terms of tech, I see there being much
more self-driving vehicles on t he roads. Hopefully <br> they find a more eco-friendly alternative soon, but I see 
self-driving vehicles coming to us in the near <br> future. I also think A.I will be much more developed and more complex soon.
Maybe these A.I will take over <br>several jobs and some of them are already taking over such as cashiers! I imagine the virus 
being handled <br> in the future as well. COVID-19 had a huge impact on basically every human on Earth and I hope this will
be <br>taken care of soon! Technology is much more advanced now so healthcare is taking a boost as well in my <br> eyes. We have
more opportunities to save peoples lives with everything we have in hospitals now and I <br>imagine there being even more high
tech in the future!
