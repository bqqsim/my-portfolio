<p class=text1>For my future, I imagine myself being in the technological field. I want to study software engineering <br> as I grow older and 
   I want to build a proper career out of it. I'm not too sure what job I want to have, <br> but I do know where I'm headed. 
    I also want to be in good shape as I grow  older. I don't want to gain<br> a lot of weight, because I know the
     field that I am headed towards requires a lot of sitting, so I will make sure <br>I don't slip up and become
      chubbier than I would like myself to be. I don't really tend to "dream",  but instead<br> I make  goals, so I can
       achieve whatever I have in mind. As of now, I would like to get a high average for <br> grade 11 and stay in good
        shape. I am also interested in the business world, so I have goals to get <br> involved in that field as well. I'm not
         too sure how for now, but I will figure it out as I get older. The <br> stock market has always been something that 
         I like to keep up with so maybe trading stocks as a <br> side hustle will be in my near future.
